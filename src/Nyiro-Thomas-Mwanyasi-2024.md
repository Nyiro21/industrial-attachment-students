 Short Professional Introduction
 
 I'm enthusiastic about applying my knowledge to solve real-world problems. Though I'm still building my skillset, I'm a fast learner with a strong work ethic. I'm particularly interested in Database Management . My goal is to ensure that databases are efficient, reliable, and secure.. JOUST's focus on science and technology aligns perfectly with my desire to develop a strong foundation for a successful career in BIS.
